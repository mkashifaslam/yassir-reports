### Sprint Summary

This sprint focused on advancing the EPayment New Architecture for the payout domain. Key capabilities delivered include provider activation, secure admin-guarded endpoints, and end-to-end CRUD APIs for payout transactions. We also refactored payout payment methods into the admin namespace with pagination for better manageability and added targeted unit tests to solidify the new workflows and repositories.
